# Lab-Metadata

**DecentraLabs** is a community project for sharing online laboratories (OLs) in a decentralized way. It enables universities and research institutions to list their labs and offer secure, blockchain-based access to users via smart contracts and a decentralized marketplace.

This repository defines the metadata schema used to describe each lab and provides guidelines on how to store and link that information within the DecentraLabs infrastructure.

## üß¨ Metadata Structure
Laboratories are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) compliant with the [EIP-721](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-721.md) standard and are uniquely identified by their corresponding token ID ($labId$). Each lab is described using a structured set of fields, enabling effective management, visibility, reservation, and access. The following metadata specification adheres to the ERC-721 Metadata JSON Schema:

```js
{
  "name": "tokenName",                // Lab name or title
  "description": "tokenDescription",  // Short but informative description of the lab
  "image": "primaryImageURI",         // Primary image URI for the lab
  "attributes": [                     // Optional and customizable attributes
    {
      "trait_type": "traitName1",
      "value": "traitValue1"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "traitName2",
      "value": [
        "traitValue2-1",
        "traitValue2-2",
        ...
        "traitValue2-M"
      ]
    },
    ...
    {
      "trait_type": "traitNameN",
      "value": "traitValueN"
    }
  ]
}

```

The provider's address is not considered part of the metadata (as it happens with $id$), but it can be obtained with the IERC721 standard ownerOf(tokenId/labId) function. If the lab provider's name is needed, a query to the ProviderFacet smart contract (using the provider's address) is required.

Metadata is divided between two storage models: on-chain and off-chain.

* The attributes stored on-chain are managed in the LabFacet smart contract.

* The attributes stored off-chain are placed in a JSON document hosted externally (e.g., on IPFS). The URI to this document is referenced by the base.uri attribute in the contract.

## ‚öñÔ∏è On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Metadata
### What Goes On-Chain
First, let's analyze the advantages and disadvantages of this way of storing data.

**Advantages:**

* Trust and immutability: Data stored on-chain is tamper-proof and publicly verifiable.

* Payment and access logic: Metadata like price, accessURI, and accessKey directly impacts business logic.

* Autonomous operations: Enables dApps and smart contracts to function trustlessly.

**Disadvantages:**

* Gas fees: Updating on-chain data requires a transaction and incurs a cost.

* Size constraints: Blockchain storage is expensive and limited.

‚úÖ In DecentraLabs, the following attributes are stored on-chain in the LabFacet contract (see the [Smart contracts specification](https://github.com/DecentraLabsCom/Smart-Contract-Specifications)) to ensure transparency and integrity of critical service-related data:

* $id$ 
* $price$
* $auth$
* $accessURI$
* $accessKey$

This design guarantees that lab providers cannot silently change core access parameters (such as access endpoints or authentication mechanisms) after a reservation has been made, without it being publicly visible on the blockchain. Any modification would require a new transaction, creating an immutable audit trail. This promotes accountability and protects users by making unauthorized or unexpected changes detectable by anyone.

### What Stays Off-Chain
Again, we first review the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

**Advantages:**

* Flexibility and Cost-Free Updates: Easily updated without gas fees (when no hash is stored onchain)

* Rich content: Enables large text, documentation, and media.

* Integration-friendly: Easier to use in traditional web systems.

**Disadvantages:**

* Less secure: While IPFS provides immutability, its availability depends on pinning and hosting strategies.

* Not trustlessly verifiable: Unless a content hash is stored on-chain.

‚úÖ Thus, DecentraLabs stores the following off-chain, referenced via base.uri:

* $name$
* $category$
* $keywords$
* $description$
* $timeSlots$
* $closes$
* $opens$
* $docs$
* $images$

üìù Note: Attributes like $timeSlots$, $opens$, and $closes$ do not affect a completed reservation, as each reservation is individually recorded (immutably) on-chain in the ReservationFacet contract (visit [Smart contracts specification](https://github.com/DecentraLabsCom/Smart-Contract-Specifications)) for more information). This makes them ideal candidates for off-chain storage, along with the other attributes listed above.

## üè∑Ô∏è Sample Metadata
### üîó Sample On-chain Metadata
```yaml
id: 1
price: 2
auth: "https://decentralabs.nebsyst.com/auth2"
accessURI: "https://sarlab.dia.uned.es/guacamole"
accessKey: "lab1"
```

### üßæ Sample Off-chain Metadata JSON

```js

  "image": "https://sarlab.dia.uned.es/labs/imgs/lab1-1.png", // First image as primary representation (ERC-721 expects one main image)
  "attributes": [ // Here goes all the attributes that are not standard in ERC-721 and can be customized. They are also optional in DecentraLabs, but extremely recommended
    {
