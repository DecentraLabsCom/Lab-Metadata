# Lab-Metadata

**DecentraLabs** is a community project for sharing online laboratories (OLs) in a decentralized way. It enables universities and research institutions to list their labs and offer secure, blockchain-based access to users via smart contracts and a decentralized marketplace.

This repository defines the metadata schema used to describe each lab and provides guidelines on how to store and link that information within the DecentraLabs infrastructure.

## üß¨ Metadata Structure
Each lab is described using a structured set of fields, enabling effective management, visibility, reservation, and access. Below is the current metadata specification:

```js
{
  id: labId,                        // Unique lab identifier
  price: labPrice,                  // Price (per hour) in $LAB tokens
  auth: labAuth,                    // URI to the authentication service that issues session tokens for lab access
  accessURI: labAccessURI,          // URI to the online laboratory service
  accessKey: labAccessKey,          // A public (non-sensitive) key or ID used for routing/access
  name: labName,                    // Lab name or title
  category: labCategory,            // Category (e.g. Physics, Electronics, Chemistry...)
  keywords: labKeywords,            // A list of search-friendly tags
  description: labDescription,      // Short but informative description of the lab
  timeSlots: labTimeSlot,           // A list of permitted access durations in minutes
  opens: labStartDate,              // The date from which the lab is open for reservations
  closes: labFinishDate,            // The date from which the lab is closed for reservations
  docs: labDocs,                    // A list of URIs to documentation associated to the lab
  images: labImages                 // A list of URIs to images of the laboratory
}
```

The provider's address is not considered part of the metadata, but can be obtained with the IERC721 standard ownerOf(tokenId/labId) function.

Metadata is divided between two storage models: on-chain and off-chain.

* The attributes stored on-chain are managed in the LabFacet smart contract.

* The attributes stored off-chain are placed in a JSON document hosted externally (e.g., on IPFS). The URI to this document is referenced by the base.uri attribute in the contract.

## ‚öñÔ∏è On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Metadata
### What Goes On-Chain
First, let's analyze the advantages and disadvantages of this way of storing data.

**Advantages:**

* Trust and Immutability: Data stored on-chain is tamper-proof and publicly verifiable.

* Payment and Access Logic: Metadata like price, accessURI, and accessKey directly impacts business logic.

* Autonomous Operations: Enables dApps and smart contracts to function trustlessly.

**Disadvantages:**

* Gas Fees: Updating on-chain data requires a transaction and incurs a cost.

* Size Constraints: Blockchain storage is expensive and limited.

‚úÖ In DecentraLabs, the following attributes are stored on-chain in the LabFacet contract (see the [Smart contracts specification](https://github.com/DecentraLabsCom/Smart-Contract-Specifications)) to ensure transparency and integrity of critical service-related data:

* $id$
* $price$
* $auth$
* $accessURI$
* $accessKey$

This design guarantees that lab providers cannot silently change core access parameters (such as access endpoints or authentication mechanisms) after a reservation has been made, without it being publicly visible on the blockchain. Any modification would require a new transaction, creating an immutable audit trail. This promotes accountability and protects users by making unauthorized or unexpected changes detectable by anyone.

### What Stays Off-Chain
Again, we first review the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

**Advantages:**

* Flexibility and Cost-Free Updates: Easily updated without gas fees (when no hash is stored onchain)

* Rich Content: Enables large text, documentation, and media.

* Integration-Friendly: Easier to use in traditional web systems.

**Disadvantages:**

* Less Secure: While IPFS provides immutability, its availability depends on pinning and hosting strategies.

* Not Trustlessly Verifiable: Unless a content hash is stored on-chain.

‚úÖ Thus, DecentraLabs stores the following off-chain, referenced via base.uri:

* $name$
* $category$
* $keywords$
* $description$
* $timeSlots$
* $closes$
* $opens$
* $docs$
* $images$

üìù Note: Attributes like $timeSlots$, $opens$, and $closes$ do not affect a completed reservation, as each reservation is individually recorded (immutably) on-chain in the ReservationFacet contract (visit [Smart contracts specification](https://github.com/DecentraLabsCom/Smart-Contract-Specifications)) for more information). This makes them ideal candidates for off-chain storage, along with the other attributes.
